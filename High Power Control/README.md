# Lab 6: "High Power" Control
#### Jack Pedicone and Joshua Gould
##### Created - 11-25-2017
##### Updated - 11-25-2017

## Dependencies
* Relay
* MSP430G2553
* MOSFET
* LEDs (optional)

## Set Requirements
"For this part of the lab, you need to focus on the different types of switching circuits along with the differences in inductive and resistive loads. The idea behind this part of the lab is to learn how not only to drive things that may require a high voltage or high current, but how to then protect your microcontroller from them."
"Using the MSP430G2553, control the state of a relay to drive a power resistor with +12V. Your README for this part should include a screenshot of the output of your MSP and the voltage across the resistor. Try to figure out the switching speed limitations of the relay experimentally. Along with what was asked in each part, you will need to utilize the DMM to determine what the current draw from each switch is and if that falls into spec with the Microcontroller."
#### Tasks
* [ ] Find differences in inductive and resistive loads

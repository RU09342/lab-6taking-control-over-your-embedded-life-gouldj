PWM without load resistance: 100mV peak to peak
PWM with 100 ohm load: 116mV 
PWM with 510 ohm load: 120mV 
PWM with 2k  ohm load: 131mV

Frequency was always around 60Hz.

One thing to note is that it became increasingly more difficult to find the triangle wave as the resistance of the load increased. The group was not sure whether this was due to some kind of interference, or a mistake with the oscilloscope.

R2R w/ no load: 3.36 Pk-Pk
100 Ohm load: 	3.35 Pk-Pk
510 Ohm load:	3.38 Pk-PK
